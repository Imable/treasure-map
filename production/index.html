                        A computer scientist with a strong emphasis on accessibility. That is what I can call myself. I have a lot of experience with Vue now. What I liked most here was getting the bread out of the freezer.

                    Part nerd, part outdoorsman, a little bit country and a little rock ‘n’ roll – Quintin somehow managed to craft not only a personality out of opposing forces, but also a career blending UX and Visual Design.
