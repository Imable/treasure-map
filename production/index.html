                            I think inside the box of possibilities; it is just a very large box. 
                            I run, hike, swim and bike. I make music, wages, apps, webpages.
                            And I do it all running on chocolate sprinkles and coffee.

                    Part nerd, part outdoorsman, a little bit country and a little rock ‘n’ roll – Quintin somehow managed to craft not only a personality out of opposing forces, but also a career blending UX and Visual Design. When not designing killer products with the fine men and women at Rally Interactive, Quintin can be found in the wild with his two kids.
